This a repo to understand the basics of the morphologial transformations of opencv.
Since we are showing some photos to understand these transformations I believe the nb is not 
light enough to be displayed on github so you may need to use nbviewer to watch it propperly.
Just go to the link below and paste the URL of the notebook. Have fun trying it on your own 
photos!
